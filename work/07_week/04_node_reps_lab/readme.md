### Your Task

Using your JavaScript knowledge and what we've learned so far in Node.js, build a simple application which has the following:

- A root page that displays a title and an image of your favorite actor/actress
- An about page which displays short biography of that person
- Pages for several of his/her movies
  - instead of writing each route individually, use arrays or objects and loops!
- Something extra! Be creative and come up with another route ðŸ˜€
