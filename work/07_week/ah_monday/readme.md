### Practice makes perfect

How comfortable with today's lessons were you? If modules are still a little mystifying, maybe make an irKat module (it can export whatever your heart desires) and import it in your main.js file from module 3. How do you start a node project? How do you add outside packages like express and morgan to your project? If you can't answer these off the top of your head, maybe you should review the markdown from module 4.

### Star Wars

Do some more of the code challenges from [Star Wars Jedi Coding Academy](../00_one_on_ones_and_js_practice/star_wars/readme.md).


### Déjà vu all over again

If you mastered them all or don't feel like doing codewars, continue the weekend work. Take this opportunity to fine tune your JavaScript fundamentals before we start bombarding you with new concepts like Express and MongoDB.
