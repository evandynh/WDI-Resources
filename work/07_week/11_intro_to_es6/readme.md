# ECMAScript 2015 (ES6)

You will hear this version of ECMAScript called many things, including ES6, ES2015, ECMAScript6, and ECMAScript2015.

### Wait - what is ECMAScript?

Ecma International (formerly the European Computer Manufacturers Association) maintains the scripting language specification standards. Languages including JavaScript, JScript, and ActionScript are based on the standards set by ECMAScript, but also have additional features.

Since the release of ECMAScript2015, JavaScript has added a ton of awesome new features!

Some of these features work in the Chrome console, but not all of them. You can use [es6fiddle.net](http://www.es6fiddle.net/) to see examples of some new features and to practice using them. 

Here are some cool things to research to get started:
