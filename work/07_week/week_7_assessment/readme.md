This week's assessment is in **two parts**:

1. Conceptual - you'll be answering multiple choice questions on paper
2. Mechanical - you'll be completing code challenges on [qualified.io](https://www.qualified.io/)

Once you complete the conceptual portion, turn it in and I will slack you a link to the mechanical portion.

Please close your computers for the conceptual portion!

Later this afternoon we will break you into groups to review this material together, so that everyone feels confident moving forward!
