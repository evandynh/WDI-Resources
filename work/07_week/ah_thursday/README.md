## Finish the animal shelter app:

## Bonus Challenge

This afternoon we talked about a users index request to the Facebook database and how that could take forever.  Time to practice reading documentation.  How would you query the database and only get the first 100 users?

- [Mongoose documentation on queries](http://mongoosejs.com/docs/queries.html)
- [Mongoose API documentation](http://mongoosejs.com/docs/api.html#query-js)

## Still going strong?

Make another node-express app.  You have now seen how to make a complete basic express app.  Time to get your reps in.  DO IT AGAIN!!  Make an app with views, connected to a database.  You can theme it however you want.  If you are like Mike and can't come up with a decent theme, do ....

### The Cupcake Shop


Using the [excellent markdowns from this week](../) as a guide, make a cupcake shop where you will be CRUDing cupcakes.  Your Cake model should have attributes of name, flavor, description, and quantity.

Here are a couple seeds for you to start with. **How do you seed a Mongo database in Node?! Google can help... (or we'll tell you next week ðŸ™ƒ)*

```js
[{name: "Strawberry CC", flavor: "strawberry with cream cheese frosting", description: "full of caffeine and sweet as sugar", quantity: 13},
{name: "Salted Caramel", flavor: "yellow cake with a salty caramel frosting", description: "Classic yellow cake with a modern salted carmel frosting", quantity: 10}]
```

Now make a full CRUD app so you can add the 10 other cupkakes in the cakeshop. As always, HAVE FUN!!!!!

## Make sure you get a good night's rest...

To let this all sink in :)
