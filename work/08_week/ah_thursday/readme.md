# Work on your Inception Deck

You must have an [Inception Deck](../../../projects/project3/inception_deck) ready to present tomorrow morning!

Make sure to review the [project requirements](../../../projects/project3/readme.md) so that you are in a good position to have your project approved. The requirements for the pitch are also in that markdown, but, just to be clear, here is what you **must do** tomorrow:

**Present an idea** to the instructors with a **deck**,
  covering the period of [project inception](https://blog.pivotal.io/labs/labs/agile-inception_knowing-what-to-build-and-where-to-start), that includes 
  (**at least**):
  
  - the application name, slogan and elevator pitch,
  - your team members and their roles/goals,
  - the problem you are going to solve with your app,
  - the solution your app provides, and the 3 central values or benefits of it,
  - your product's MVP:
    - wireframes for the central interactions, and
    - an underlying data model,
    - a list of included technologies and third-party APIs consumed (if any)
      - this inlcudes the OAuth provider(s) your app will use for authentication
