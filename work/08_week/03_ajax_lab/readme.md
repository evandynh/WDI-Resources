# Practicing AJAX

## Introduction

> ***Note:*** _This can be a pair programming activity or done independently._

You're about to write a lot of AJAX-backed JavaScript – using either jQuery or Vanilla JS, if you're feeling confident – that will complete our little Doughnut Shop app.

Make use of the fantastic and delicious [Doughnuts API](https://wsmd-backend.herokuapp.com/api/doughnuts).  Your task is to use your JS skills to list out all the doughnuts in our database and get your form working so you can add more.

## Exercise

#### Requirements

- Implement a jQuery AJAX client for a simple REST service
- Build an application that uses AJAX to update a client
- Update an existing API resource from your client with new data
- Destroy an existing API resource from your client

#### Starter Code

You'll find the same starter code you had in the last lesson in the `starter-code` folder. It's a basic index and some styling, along with an empty `js/app.js`.

#### Deliverable

Make a list of existing doughnuts underneath the form, make the form work, and then build your app to add to the list of donuts - using the information from newly created donuts - without refreshing the page.
