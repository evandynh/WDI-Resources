# Wrap Up Project 1 (optional, but encouraged)

After project one demos, students usually have a lot of ideas of how to improve their game. You really won't have much time to go back to it until the course ends, so, while it's still fresh in your mind, add some comments in your code and/or add stretch goals to your trello board so that future you knows what current you wants to add or change.

# Let's Learn Ruby (mandatory)

For the next three weeks we will be coding in Ruby and using Ruby on Rails. Take this weekend to start familiarizing yourself with Ruby. Just like the prework you did before the course started, this is important prep so that you won't be seeing Ruby for the very first time on Monday.

Do at least one thing on this list before Monday (preferably all four!).

1.  [Try Ruby](http://tryruby.org/)
2.  [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/ruby)
3.  Do codewars challenges in Ruby. Better yet, do them in JavaScript and Ruby.
4.  If you want more resources, try some of [these](http://www.skilledup.com/guides/learn-ruby-programming-language-course-guide)
