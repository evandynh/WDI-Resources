### Practice makes perfect

Complete the [lab](../02_angular_controllers_and_views_lab/readme.md) from module 4 if you haven't yet.

If you want more practice, redo the lab, or check out [this course](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-angularjs) on codecademy. It uses `$scope`, but the concepts are the same.
