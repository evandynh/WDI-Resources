# Practice Angular!

## Option 1

Finish the [Double Double](../ah_wednesday/readme.md) from last night's after hours.

## Option 2

Continue working on any labs from this week that you didn't finish:

1. [`$http` lab](../10_angular_http_lab/readme.md)
2. [Angular Services Lab](../08_angular_services_lab/readme.md)
3. [Angular Directives Lab](../06_angular_directives_lab/README.md)

## Option 3

Add another resource to Double Double, add UI-Router to one of the apps you've built this week, or build a completely new app from scratch!

##Zzzzz..

Whichever option you choose, make sure to get plenty of rest and come in ready to learn some more tomorrow!
