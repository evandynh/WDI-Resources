## SWBAT:
* Create a basic mobile app
* Show data from your API using $http and ng-repeat
* Run the app on your phone!

## Roadmap:
* Demo
* Install Ionic
* Exploring the generated app
* Add $http to controller
* CORS
* Add ng-repeat to html

## Notes:
We have a bowties API running on heroku, you can use this with the URL:

* [http://bowties.herokuapp.com/api/bowties](http://bowties.herokuapp.com/api/bowties)

You should download and install the Ionic View app on your phone. It's available in the app store for both iOS and Android.

To run your ionic app do an `ionic upload` from the terminal (while inside the folder for this app). Then the app will be available to run in ionic view.
