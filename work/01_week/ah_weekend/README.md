# More? 

Review all the materials from Week 1.  Did you finish all the labs?  If not, try and finish them.  Did one of the lessons go too fast?  Re-read the markdown and figure out what you still don't understand.  Did one of the labs seem complex?  Start it all over and try and identify pain points.
