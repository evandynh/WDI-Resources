At the end of certain weeks we'll assess your progress through the week's
material with a series of short questions.  This gives us a data set to talk
about with you during one on one meetings and code reviews.

You'll be answering these questions by hand! Please close your computers!

Later this afternoon we will break you into groups to review this material together, so that everyone feels confident moving forward!
