# Project 2 Prep - Mandatory

---
###IMPORTANT: Send Kate your main repo and trello links BEFORE 10pm tonight!!
---

This [AH assignment](./project_prep.md) will help you prepare the materials you will need for your Project 2 pitch **tomorrow**.

For pitches, you will be expected to give a 2-3 minute presentation about your Project 2. It should describe what your mvp is and any stretch goals. You must also send links to #KaKe for your:

1. Trello Board with User Stories, Wireframes, and ERD
2. GitHub repo (don't `rails new` yet, just create the repo with a `readme.md` and your wireframes and ERD - Kate will show you how to add your new rails app to the existing repo tomorrow!)
