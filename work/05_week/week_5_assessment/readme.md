This week's assessment is in **two parts**:

1. Mechanical - you'll be writing code
2. Conceptual - you'll be reading & writing code

Once you complete the mechanical portion, turn it in and we will give you the conceptual portion.

You'll be answering these questions by hand! Please close your computers!

Later this afternoon we will break you into groups to review this material together, so that everyone feels confident moving forward!
