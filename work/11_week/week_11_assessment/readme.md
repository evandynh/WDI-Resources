This week's assessment is in **two parts**:

1. Conceptual - you'll be answering multiple choice questions on paper
2. Mechanical - you'll be completing code challenges on [qualified.io](https://www.qualified.io/)

Once you complete the conceptual portion, turn it in and I will slack you a link to the mechanical portion.

Please close your computers for the conceptual portion!

Some things to remember for the mechanical portion:

- Treat this assessment like it's part of a job interview.
- You may use class markdowns and Google for *reference*, but do not simply copy and paste an entire function and enter it as your own.
- Do not consult your classmates or other people.
- Remember that this assessment is timed. There are three parts and you have thirty minutes. Do not spend more than ten minutes on one challenge without at least attempting the others.
- Do not worry about completing a challenge with the fewest lines, or in the fanciest way; just make it pass the tests! If you finish early, you can go back and refactor, but don't run out of time trying to make it fancy.
- Remember to hit the "Submit Solution" button for each challenge!
