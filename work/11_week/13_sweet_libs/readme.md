# It's _Sweet Libs_ time!

Sweet libs is an opportunity to test your ability to pick up new technology without someone walking you through it. You will have the day to read the docs, practice writing code, and work to understand how and why someone would use a specific library/framework.

### For this project you will be:

* Working in small groups to research a topic that you know little to nothing about
* Working through a tutorial
* Teaching the topic to the class

### Timeline

You will have from a few minutes from now until 3:30 to work with your group. Presentations will start at 3:30pm. Each group will have 20 minutes to present. Just like with project 3 demos, everyone in the group should talk.

### Expectations

##### Quick start guide

Each group needs to create a "getting started" tutorial on their topic. It should be:

  - Written in markdown and in a Github Repo.
  - You should include screen shots, gifs, diagrams, or other tools that will help make the guide as useful as possible (but don't waste time on styling, this project is about content, not style).
  - You should look to the offical docs/start guides for inspiration, but make yours more approachable for WDI students. Think about what assumed knowledge is in the offical docs, and unassume it. Fill in the missing pieces.
  - Make sure to note dependencies, and similarities/differences to other types of tech we've studied.
  - Any code files that are needed should be included in this markdown. This includes things like Gemfile or package.json!

##### An app

Every group must have a repository for their tutorial/app hosted on Github. This can be in the same repo as your "getting started" tutorial or a separate one, it's up to you.

Follow a tutorial of your choice (the official docs are usually a good first place to look) to build a small app.

*Unlike with class projects, you* **will** *be using your own computer to demo, so you don't need to deploy your app, but you may. Some of these sweet libs are more difficult to deploy than others.*

##### Presentation

Each group needs to prepare a presentation where they walk the rest of the class through the basics of the library/framework, demo the app they made, and talk about what use cases the tech has. 

- Why would someone choose to use your group's tech? You should be prepared to answer questions from the class - and when you are in the audience, ask questions of the other groups. 
- You should feel free to use whatever teaching techniques you'd like! Make sure to make your presentations interesting and engaging, as everyone has to sit through them ðŸ˜€
- Talk about what hurdles there were with the documentation, what knowledge was assumed, and what you had to research.

##### Where do we start?

- Discuss the technology with your group. Do any of you know about this technology at all? Has anyone worked with it before?
- Read the documentation. You don't have to read every word of every page, but identify the important beginner pages and divide them up amongst your team so you guys can get the gist of it fairly quickly and talk about it.
- Do a tutorial! The websites for all of these technologies have documentation **and** step-by-step tutorials. Just like we dove right in to React on Tuesday with a todo app and learned as we went, you can do the same thing this morning with your group. There are also plenty of other tutorials on the web.
