# React Lab

Now that you've had a few modules of React lessons, it's time to build something! In groups of two or three, build a very simple Todo app using React.

## Getting Started

1. Draw a basic wireframe for the app. This should be a very simple app: a list and a form to add new todos.
2. Figure out how many components you need.
3. Identify any props or state you will need.
4. Copy the boilerplate app we built in the last module and use that as starter code.
5. Build it!
