It's your favorite, another Tic-Tac-Toe game!

We're going to be doing this code-along using not a lovely, tailor-made readme, but documentation as it appears in the wild. Incidentally, you won't need to keep this document open during the lesson. Before you close it, please do three things:

1. Open the [Tic Tac Toe Tutorial](https://facebook.github.io/react/tutorial/tutorial.html) in a new tab.
2. Open the [Code-Along Tracker](https://ga-classtime.herokuapp.com/) in a new tab.
3. Make sure you've pulled from the class repo, so that you have the solution code locally, should you need it (there's also starter code, but you don't really need it - you'll see).

> You can complete the tutorial directly in CodePen if you want, but I suggest that you copy the starter code from each file into your own files. This will allow you to use the Chrome dev tools later.
