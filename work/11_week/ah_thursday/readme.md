# Project Preparation

Tomorrow morning, you'll be pitching your final project! Spend some time tonight finishing up your ERD, wireframes, etc.

If you're planning on using a new technology, make sure to do a tutorial or two!

*Send Kate your repo* **AND** *trello links by 8pm tonight.* Remember, you can keep updating them after you send me the link, so it's a good idea to just send them ASAP so you don't forget ðŸ™‚
