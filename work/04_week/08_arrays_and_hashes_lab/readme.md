Do the following in `irb`.

Rewrite the following code using a hash called `vladimir_putins_brain`

```
name = "vladimir putin"
launch_code = "a5Mjp257GHMGH23e5qxE"
fav_hobby = "Riding ponies"
prideful = true
```

- Use irb to return the string "Riding ponies"
- Use irb to return the string "a5Mjp257GHMGH23e5qxE"
- Use irb to add the key-value pair "obsessive_crush" => "Condoleezza Rice"
- Use irb to add the key-value pair :torture_count => 931
- puts("#{name} loves #{fav_hobby}")

Rewrite the code below using a hash called `batman`

```
f_name = "Bruce"
l_name = "Wayne"
billionaire = true
alter_ego = "Batman"

msg = "#{alter_ego} is the secret identity of #{f_name} #{l_name}, an American #{billionaire ? "billionaire, industrialist, and philanthropist" : "hobo"}."

puts(msg)
```

Rewrite the following code using hashes and arrays

```
villain_1 = "The Penguin"
villain_2 = "The Joker"
villain_3 = "The Riddler"
sidekick_1_f_name = "Jason"
sidekick_1_l_name = "Todd"
sidekick_1_alter_ego = "Robin"
sidekick_2_f_name = "Dick"
sidekick_2_l_name = "Grayson"
sidekick_2_alter_ego = "Robin"
sidekick_3_f_name = "Tim"
sidekick_3_l_name = "Drake"
sidekick_3_alter_ego = "Robin"

origin = "Having witnessed the murder of his parents as a child, he swore revenge on #{villain_2}, an oath tempered with a sense of justice with his best friend #{sidekick_1_f_name} #{sidekick_2_l_name} otherwise known as #{sidekick_2_alter_ego}" 

puts(origin)
```

Rewrite the code below using a hash called `irkat`

```
course = "WDI"
location = "Santa Monica"
instance = 43
instructor_1 = "Kate"
instructor_2 = "Ira"
num_students = 19

description = "#{instructor_1} and #{instructor_2} are teaching #{num_students} in #{course} #{instance} in #{location}."
```

Make an array within `irkat` with string values for all student names (check the wall if you can't remember ðŸ˜‰).

Sort the student array so that the names appear alphabetically.

Select and count how many student names have the letter e.
