# Practice Database Design

## Introduction

To practice modeling databases, you'll be tasked with drawing ERDs for a handful of hypothetical applications. Think about what models you would need and what tables you'd create, including the associated attributes and how they would related to other tables.

Work in groups or on your own to draw out diagrams for one of the apps below. You'll be drawing on the wall, so snap photos of the drawings when you've finished for safe keeping.

Remember to consider all different angles in each of these examples. What jobs relationships exist? What people are there? What objects and intangible ideas are necessary? How would you organize it?

## Exercise

#### Requirements

- Pick one(or more if you want extra practice) of the following, design the table relationships, and draw them:

  - an app to run a grocery store
  - an app to run an airline
  - an app to run a school
  - an app to run a team of developers

- Or real life examples if thats easier:

  - Facebook
  - Twitter
  - Reddit
  - Instapaper
  - AirBnB
  - Tumblr

#### Deliverable

An ERD diagram, using crow's foot notation, of whatever app you choose.  For example:

</p>

> Note: this example has "Items" as placeholders for the attributes.
