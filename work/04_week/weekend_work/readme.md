## Do you <3 Rails yet?

No, still a little confused? Understandable. We threw a lot of information at you very quickly. Next week we will break down some of the parts of Rails so that it hopefully gets a little clearer. In preparation for this, read Michael Hartl's Ruby on Rails Tutorial. This is a very well-respected book that teaches the ins and outs of rails. Try to get through Chapter 5. Some things to keep in mind:

* Chapter 1 talks about git and bitbucket, just use github instead of bitbucket. It also talks about deploying to Heroku; don't stress too much over that, we will talk about that next week. Also, you should already have rails installed, so you can skip that step.
* Chapter 5 talks about Bootstrap. We will be going over Bootstrap in class next week, but it's always helpful to see things more than once!
* I would also highly advise that you read chapter 6.1 that talks about the User model.
