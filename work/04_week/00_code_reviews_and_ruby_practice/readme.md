# Ruby Practice

First, make sure to complete the GA Feedback you received by email. This must be completed this morning.

We will be starting Ruby lessons this afternoon, but we don't want that to be the first time you're seeing the Ruby language. If you didn't get through [Try Ruby](http://tryruby.org/) and [Codecademy Ruby](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/ruby) this weekend, you can work on those. If you already got through those, check out [Ruby Koans](http://rubykoans.com/).
