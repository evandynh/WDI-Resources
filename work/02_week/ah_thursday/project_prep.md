# Project Prep!

Below are the necessary steps you must complete before you can begin writing the code for your app. They do not happen in order, but instead they all go on at the same time. They're broken this way arbitrarily.

Deliverable are at [the bottom](#deliverables).

#### Slack your repo and trello links to Kate [before](http://www.clocktab.com/) 9am tomorrow.

## Planning

### Create a Repo for your project

Create a new repo locally (in either `~/code` or `~/code/wdi` or `~/code/wdi/projects` or wherever you want to make it, just *not inside another repo*), and connect it to GitHub. Ensure that the repo has a file `README.md` and a folder named `assets`. You will add your code files to this same repo later. **DO NOT START CODING UNTIL AFTER THE PITCH!!!**

For all of planning, add any information you have to your `README.md` and push it up. Any images should be added to `assets` and displayed in your `README.md`. Here are some more resources for information about markdown:

- [Github Flavored Markdown Tutorial][ghfm]
- [Markdown cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)

Make sure your repo looks good and has the name of your project on it! Also include a link to your trello board in the body of your readme.

### Draw Wireframes

Create wireframes for your game. While you can use special applications to build your wireframes, please start by using "pen & paper" (or "marker & desk"). Take pictures and add them to your repo's `assets` folder. These are often called **Low-fidelity** wireframes.

Keep in mind, if you have multiple pages, these discrete wireframes should be connected by "flows" (or arrows) describing how a user can arrive at any wireframed state/page from any other. 

It is okay to only have one wireframe if you only have one page. If you use jQuery to change elements on your page so that it looks significantly different, make multiple wireframes.

### Write User Stories

Create *user stories* for your game. Add them to your Project 1 Trello board. Make sure your Trello board is **public** so we can see it. Make sure that your stories follow the format **ROLE**, **GOAL**, **REASON**:

```
As a ROLE (user type), I want to GOAL, so that REASON.

Ex: As a player, I want to have the slammer activated by a click,
    so that I can control the pace of the game and feel like
    I'm actually playing it for real!
```

You may omit the reason, but only if it is **patently obvious**.

> Be comprehensive! Think wide and far about all the features (phrased as user stories) that you can! You should be making these **while** you are working on your wireframes â€“ the processes feed in to one another.

All user stories should be placed in the **Ice Box** list to start.

Do not make user stories from the developer POV. "As a developer, I want to add CSS so that it looks good" is *not* a user story. All user stories must be from the POV of a user.

### Identify an MVP (Sprint Planning)

Classify the user stories that are the minimum necessary in order
to make your game work. These are your MVP (minimum-viable product). Move these stories to *sprint*.

Also: pick the first user story that you will work on and
move it to the *current* list in Trello. Your current list should have what you're working on *currently*.

**Note:** do not write any user stories from the point of view of the programmer!

## Deliverables

1.  A completed repo on GitHub, with a `README.md` and images stored in `assets`.
2.  A series of wireframes (one or many, depending on your game) describing what will be visible to the user who uses your site.
3.  All of the user stories, in your project's Trello board. Be sure that your board is set to public so that your instructors can access it. Your user stories will flow through the following lists:
 - `Ice Box` (strech goals)
 - `Sprint` (MVP)
 - `Current` (one or two stories you are currently working on)
 - `Done` (stories that you've completed)

**Slack your repo and trello links to Kate before 9am tomorrow.**
