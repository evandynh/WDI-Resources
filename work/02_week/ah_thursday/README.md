# Project 1 Prep - Mandatory

This [AH assignment](./project_prep.md) will help you prepare the materials you will need for your Project 1 pitch tomorrow.

**Slack your repo and Trello links to Kate BEFORE 9am tomorrow.**

For pitches, you will be expected to give a **3 minute** presentation about your Project 1.  It must include:

1. Wireframes
2. User Stories
3. Description of MVP (User stories that must be finished to meet the minimum project requirements)
4. Stretch goals (Things you would like to accomplish after you complete MVP)
5. Technologies you will use

In order to have time for everyone to pitch and also have time for assessment review, you **must** keep your presentation at 3 minutes maximum. This is good practice for an elevator pitch!

### BONUS

All ready for your pitch? Are you sure? Did you slack Kate you repo and trello links? Okay, practice some responsive CSS.
