# WDI Week 02 Assessment

Congratulations on your second week of WDI! ðŸŽ‰ Before you start your first project, let's do another assessment!

Just like last week, we're going to assess your progress through the week's material with a series of short questions.  This gives us a data set to talk about with you during one on one meetings and code reviews.

This week's assessment is in **two parts**:

1. Mechanical - you'll be writing code
2. Conceptual - you'll be reading code

Once you complete the mechanical portion, turn it in and we will give you the conceptual portion.

You'll be answering these questions by hand! Please close your computers!

Later this afternoon we will break you into groups to review this material together, so that everyone feels confident moving forward!
