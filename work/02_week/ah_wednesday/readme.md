# jQuery!

You've had a full day of jQuery - now it's time to practice on your own! First, finish [Fellowship of the Bling](../10_jquery_lab/readme.md).

Then, build a todo list!

#Todo List

For this exercise you'll build a simple todo app. A todo app is the canonical app, so much so that it is used to benchmark different front-end frameworks.

Below is a wireframe that outlines what the app should look like. You can also probably glean details of its functionality from the mockup. You will most certainly work with mockups/wireframes in your career as a developer, so this is good practice to get now. 

*Styling is not the focus of this lab, so don't spend too much time on the CSS - just focus on functionality!*

* User should be able to enter text into the input text box, which will add a new item to the bottom of the list.
* "Items Remaining" should keep track of how many list items the user has completed. This count changes every time the user checks off an item in the "Completed" column. 
* A User should be able to remove a specified item from the list by clicking the remove button.
