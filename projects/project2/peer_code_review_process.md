# Peer Code Reviews

For project 2, the only written feedback you will get for your project (if you pass) is your peer code review. Your one-on-one meeting on Monday with an instructor will be spent discussing any part of your project that you want.

## Process

1. Download the Peer Code Review Template from slack
2. Change the file name to `P2 Peer Code Review for <reviewee's name> by <your name>`
3. Spend about twenty minutes walking through the peer code review template with your partner
4. Slack the completed sheet back to Kate by 9:45
