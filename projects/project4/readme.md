![](http://jingabrewing.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/nye-wide.jpg)

### Overview

**You’ve come a long way, and it's time to show it.** 
This will be your most advanced project to date.

**You get to call the shots and invent your own idea**, choosing a framework & tools that are appropriate for what you want to build. Pull from everything you've learned so far, and **tackle something that'll push you a little outside of your comfort zone.**

Make sure your project is **something that represents the breadth of your learning**, and make sure it's **something that looks nice**!

As always, Project Week will be a sprint, and doesn't end on the final day. There's demo day ready and then there's Meet & Hire ready. Keep that in mind, and keep your MVP focused!

### Project Objectives

- Write code you want people to read, code that you're proud of and want to show off (DRY, properly indented, etc.)
- Build something nice and small (not a sprawling mess, but a real MVP)
- Build something with potential to grow (so that you can continue adding features to it after the course - remember, you have a month between the end of the course and the Meet & Hire!)
- Manage your time and emotions well (remember: this is a test-run for your life post-course)

### Technical Requirements

You will be working individually on this project unless you get approval from Kate **by 9am Thursday morning** to work in a group of your choice.

The Outcomes team has told us that employers prefer to see solo projects, so they can see what you can do individually. Because of this, we *strongly* recommend that you work alone.

Your app must:

* **Be a full-stack application** with frontend *and* backend code
* **Implement thoughtful user stories** prioritized to help guide you
* **Be deployed online** so that it's publicly accessible

---

### Timeline

#### Friday, April 7 (9 AM) - Deliverables Due

- A Github repo
- A `readme.md` in your repo with:
	- A single paragraph description of what you want your project to be
	- a list of what technologies you plan to use 
- A *publicly accessible* Trello board with:
	- User Stories written in the format "As a `<role>` I want `<feature>` so that `<reason>`"
	- User stories organized into lists, for example:
  		- Current (what you're currently working on - this should only contain one card)
  		- Sprint (what you hope to have finished in this sprint, i.e. your MVP)
  		- Ice Box (your wishlist or strech goals)
  		- Done (what you've completed - this should be empty on Friday morning!)
- ERD (in your repo and/or trello board)
- Wireframes (in your repo and/or trello board)

#### Thursday, April 13th (11 PM)
- Code Freeze (get some sleep! Friday will be a big day!)

#### Friday, April 14th (9 AM) - Deliverables Due

You should have:

* A **working, full-stack application**, hosted somewhere on the internet
* A **git repository hosted on Github**, with a link to your hosted project, and frequent commits dating back to the very beginning of the project with **feature branches** (you can delete your branches once they are merged to your master branch, the merges will still show in the commit history).
* **A `readme.md` file** with:
    * A screenshot of your completed application
    * Explanations of the **technologies** and **concepts** used
    * A couple of paragraphs about the **general approach you took**
    * **Installation instructions** for a potential employer to clone down and run your app locally
    * Descriptions of any **unsolved problems** or **major hurdles** you had to overcome
    * BONUS: a table of your **routes** with their **auth** requirements
* A *publicly accessible* **Trello board** that contains:
    * Your **user stories** organized in the appropriate lists (ice box, sprint, current, done)
    * Your **wireframes** – sketches of major views / interfaces in your application (could be in your repo instead)
    * Your **ERD** diagramming your models and their relationships (could be in your repo instead)
    * **It's a good idea to update your ERD and wireframes if your app changes as you're building!**

You should be prepared to give a short presentation (length TBA once I know how many projects there will be) during which you:

- demo your application
- show a little bit of code (not all of your code)
- tell the class what you are most proud of, and what feature you are going to implement next

After you've finished your presentation, you will have a little time to answer questions from the class about your work.

### Suggested Ways to Get Started

* **Don’t get caught up in too many awesome features** – simple is always better. Build something impressive that does one thing well.
* **Design first.** Planning with user stories & wireframes before writing code means you won't get distracted changing your mind – you'll know what to build, and you can spend your time wisely by just building it.
* **Don’t hesitate to write throwaway code** to solve short term problems.
* **Read the docs for whatever technologies / frameworks / APIs you use**. If you are using any technologies that we have not taught in class, we will of course still help you, but we will not teach the new technologies to you during project week - that's all you!
* **Write your code DRY** and **build your APIs RESTful**.
* **Be consistent** with your code style.
* **Commit early, commit often.** Don’t be afraid to break something because you can always go back in time to a previous version.
* **Keep user stories small and well-defined**, and remember – user stories focus on what a user needs, not what development tasks need accomplishing.
* **Write code another developer wouldn't have to ask you about**. Do your naming conventions make sense? Would another developer be able to look at your app and understand what everything is?
* **Make it all well-formatted.** There is no excuse for non-perfect indentation. Can we find the start and end of every div, curly brace, etc? (If you're struggling with indentation, now is your last chance to practice before you're out in the world, so take advantage of this time!)
* **Comment your code** where it makes sense. Will someone understand what is going on in each block or function?
* **Write pseudocode before you write actual code.** Thinking through the logic of something helps.
