### Overview

Let's start out with something fun - **a game!**

Everyone will get a chance to **be creative**, and work through some really **tough programming challenges**. Since you've already gotten your feet wet with Tic Tac Toe, it's up to you to come up with a fun and interesting game to build.

**You will be working individually for this project**, but we'll be guiding you along the process and helping as you go. Show us what you've got!

**You may not follow a tutorial to build your game.**

## Objectives

- Manage yourself (your time and your emotions) when given a large amount of unstructured work
- Gain experience building a more complex application
- Document your work and share it with the public in an effective and articulate manner
- Learn new technologies by reading documentation and experimenting

## Project Sprint Schedule

Even though it's a project week, **we still take attendance at 9am sharp**.  
Your breaks and lunch will still be at the same times as during lesson weeks.     
You may work in the lounge for project time, but you **must** be back in the classroom by 2pm for stand ups and again by 4:55pm for a daily wrap-up. We will take attendance in the afternoon.  
**You must stay on campus until 5pm.**

### Technical Requirements

Your app must:

* **Render a game in the browser**
* **Switch turns** between two players (if it's a two-player game)
* **Design logic for winning** & **visually display which player won**
* **Include separate HTML / CSS / JavaScript files**
* Stick with **KISS (Keep It Simple Son)** and **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)** principles
* Use **jQuery** for **DOM manipulation** and **vanilla JavaScript** for **game logic**
* **Deploy your game online**, where the rest of the world can access it
* Use **semantic markup** for HTML and CSS (adhere to best practices)

---

### Necessary Deliverables

* A **working game, built by you**, hosted somewhere on the internet
* A **git repository hosted on Github**, with a link to your hosted game, and *frequent commits* dating back to the very beginning of the project (You should make your first commit this Friday!)
* A **link to your hosted working game** in the URL section of your Github repo
* **A `readme.md` file** with explanations of the technologies used, the approach taken, installation instructions, unsolved problems, and any other information you want to include.

### Suggested Ways to Get Started

* **Break the project down into different components** (data, presentation, views, style, DOM manipulation) and brainstorm each component individually. Use pseudocode! Use whiteboards!
* **Use your Development Tools** (console.log, inspector, alert statements, etc) to debug and solve problems. *Your console should ALWAYS be open!* **YOUR CONSOLE SHOULD ALWAYS BE OPEN!**
* **Use your time wisely** You have the weekend leading into project week. Get as much coding done as you can over the weekend, and come prepared with questions/blockers on Monday, instead of, you know... _procrastinating_.
* **Commit early, commit often.** Don’t be afraid to break something because you can always go back in time to a previous version.
* **Consult documentation resources** (MDN, jQuery, etc.) at home to better understand what you’ll be getting into.
* **Don’t be afraid to write code that you know you will have to remove later.** Create temporary elements (buttons, links, etc) that trigger events if real data is not available. For example, if you’re trying to figure out how to change some text when the game is over but you haven’t solved the win/lose game logic, you can create a button to simulate that until then.
* **Don't wait until Friday (demo day) morning to deploy for the first time** Deploying doesn't mean you have to stop working, so deploy early in case it takes longer than you anticipate (it probably will!), and then redeploy when you have more features ready.

### Potential Project Ideas

<!--##### Concentration
Sometimes just called "Memory", it's a card game in which all of the cards are laid face down on a surface and two cards are flipped face up over each turn. If you get all the matching cards, you've won!-->

##### Trivia
Test your wits & knowledge with whatever-the-heck you know about (so you can actually win). Guess answers, have the computer tell you how right you are!

##### Blackjack
Make a one player game where people down on their luck can lose all their money by guessing which card the computer will deal next!

##### Simon
A game with 4 colored "buttons". In this game, a round consists of lighting up one or more buttons in a random order, after which the player must reproduce that order by pressing the buttons. As the game progresses, the number of buttons to be pressed increases.

### Project Feedback + Evaluation

You will receive feedback on your project from an instructor and a grade of pass or fail. You will be shown the grading rubric before demo day.
