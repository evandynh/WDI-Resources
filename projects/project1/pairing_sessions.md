# Check-In Schedule

For the Project 1 sprint, each student will have one designated five-minute check-in on Monday and Wednesday with Kate. This is your time to ask a question or two, get some guidance, and just catch me up on your progress in the previous 24 hours. It is not a time to work on a problem together - it's *really* only five minutes.

Please make sure to note when your appointments are so you will be prepared with questions!

If you would like to switch to a different time, you may ask another student to switch with you. Please slack me if you switch so I know when I'm meeting with each of you.

There will be plenty of chances for longer help sessions with me and with TAs at other points in the day.
