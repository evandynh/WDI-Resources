# Project 3 Groups!

Your first task as a group is to come up with a team name! Once you have a name, make a GitHub Organization and invite irKat to join the organization!

*Updated to use self-assigned team names*

# Instructor Time

Instead of 1:1 check ins, each group will have 35 minutes per day with Kate set aside for them. The group members can decide how to use that time. We can all work together, or maybe one or two people need help on specific problems. *At a minimum, a representative from the group needs to give me an update on the project progress.*
