<!-- Highlights of the iphone unveil: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KfrSzyXmiw -->

### SWBAT

* Understand why we use an inception deck
* Begin writing an inception deck for project 3


### What is an Inception?

* The birth of the project.  
* Develops a consensus for the team.

<!-- Uncertainty over time -->
### Purpose

* Eliminate confusion and misunderstanding  
* Set expectations
* Highlight Challenges
* Get alignment

* **All of this happens before the project begins!!**

* By the end, it's way too late.

* The idea is to reduce uncertainty

Enter...the inception Deck!

* *A series of 10 questions to help with project chartering*

### 1. Ask, why we are here?

* We make a ton of trade offs when building software, its important to know what things to give up and what things to keep, and the only way to do this is by knowing why you are here.
* The #1 reason for doing this project

### 2. Create an elevator pitch!

* An elevator pitch is how you would pitch it in the time it takes to ride in an elevator.
* Brings clarity and focus
* Parts of an elevator pitch
  * 1. For [target customer]
  * 2. Who [statement of need]
  * 3. The [product name]
  * 4. Is a [product category]
  * 5. That [key benefit/reason to buy]
  * 6. Unlike [primary competitors]
  * 7. Our product [statement of differentiation]

* e.g.
  * 1. For [construction managers]
  * 2. Who [need to safeley track people's locations at the construction site]
  * 3. The [Construction Safety App]
  * 4. Is a [communication tool]
  * 5. That [allows people to be evacuated safely from sites in the event of an emergency]
  * 6. Unlike [our current paper based system]
  * 7. Our product [is web-based and can be accessed by all contractors from anywhere]

* e.g.
  * 1. For [old people]
  * 2. Who [are scared of technology]
  * 3. The [gamebox 3000]
  * 4. Is a [game system]
  * 5. That [they think their grandchildren will love]
  * 6. Unlike [the real xbox]
  * 7. Our product [costs $50]



* Now do it for... the Wii? An e-cigarette? A Vespa? Something else?


### 3. Product Box?
If your product was in a box what would it look like? Would you buy it?

Features vs benefits.

* Max torque of 20.2Nm and a weight of only 148kg => Pass cars easily
* Only 30 inches wide => weave around other vehicles on the road
* 65-70mpg => Save money on gas
* Comes in red, blue, green => Impress your friends with your sense of Italian style!

* Now Do it for... the Wii? An e-cigarette? A Vespa? Something else?

### 4. **NOT** List
Define The things that are **IN** (big rocks you have to move)
The things that are **OUT** (stuff you wont sweat)
The stuff that's unresolved that you'll get to later.

* Think about how you might have thought about this for your Tic-Tac-Toe game. 

### 5. Meet your neighbors
Define your community, who your neighbors are, and external assets that you have.

* Legal department?
* Human Resources?
* Marketing?

### 6. Show the solution

Visualize the solution, draw it out and figure out what you're up against technically and making sure everyone is on the same page.

Don't want to find out weeks down the line that one person really hates a certain technology and just drops out.

### 7. What keeps us up at night

Your risk slide!

* If you hear something crazy, get it out there!
* This is your opportunity to raise any issues or concerns you have.
* As well as hear from the other side and other team members.
* Better now than leaving it till later.

* e.g.
	* Team not co-located
	* Unproven technology
	* Security concerns

### 8. Size it up!

This is where you actually write stories and point them out. How long will this project take?


### 9. Be clear on what's going to give

In a perfect world, everything would always be perfect, but, sadly, there never will be enough time, money, and sanity to complete everything, so you have to decide what you're willing to give on and what has to stay firm.
The main 4 are:

* Time  
* Budget  
* Scope  
* Quality

Draw some sliders with 4 points from on, to off, no thing can occupy the same position.

### 10. What's it going to take?

Figure out who is great at what on the team, what they're competent at, and what is expected of them.


**GO DO IT**
