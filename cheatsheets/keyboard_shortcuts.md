### Keyboard Shortcuts

Spectacle makes use of several [keyboard shortcuts][3] that trigger specific _window actions_. A window action is nothing more than a command that tells Spectacle how to change the size and/or position of a particular window.

A keyboard shortcut consists of one or more modifier keys paired with a character key. The common modifier keys Spectacle takes advantage of are:

| Symbol    | Key         |
|:---------:|:-----------:|
|  &#8984;  | Command Key |
|  &#8963;  | Control Key |
|  &#8997;  | Option Key  |
|  &#8679;  | Shift Key   |

The default keyboard shortcuts can be changed at any time. Use new key combinations to trigger window actions, or clear particular keyboard shortcuts to disable window actions entirely.

### Basic window actions

To move a window to the center of the screen use the &#8997;&#8984;C keyboard shortcut. Centered windows will __not__ have their size altered. Maximize a window using the &#8997;&#8984;F shortcut.

Windows can be moved to a number of predefined regions of the screen:

- _Move to the left half_ &#8212; &#8997;&#8984;&#8592;
- _Move to the right half_ &#8212; &#8997;&#8984;&#8594;
- _Move to the top half_ &#8212; &#8997;&#8984;&#8593;
- _Move to the bottom half_ &#8212; &#8997;&#8984;&#8595;
<br /><br />
- _Move to the upper left_ &#8212; &#8963;&#8984;&#8592;
- _Move to the lower left_ &#8212; &#8963;&#8679;&#8984;&#8592;
- _Move to the upper right_ &#8212; &#8963;&#8984;&#8594;
- _Move to the lower right_ &#8212; &#8963;&#8679;&#8984;&#8594;
