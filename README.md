## Classroom Code of Conduct <a id="coc"></a>

**To be updated as needed**

- *Silence* cell phones and laptops in the classroom
- Be considerate
- Help each other
- If someone's being noisy, politely ask them to stop instead of silently fuming
- Don't be afraid to ask questions
- Be supportive of other people's ideas
- Don't talk when instructors are talking so we can all hear
- Don't talk over anyone
- Be a driver! Own your work
- Do your best on your own to solve a problem before asking for help

## Repo Structure and Use

#### What's in here?

- The **work** directory is where you can find your class work!
- Weekly directories (**00_week**) contain in-class code samples and
  files required for labs and lessons.
- The **cheatsheets** directory will be your go-to for cheatsheets and
    procedural instructions (like installs, deployment steps, etc.).
- The **projects** directory contains information and resources for unit
  projects.

#### What can I do?

As a student, you have **pull** permissions on this repository.
You should copy ("clone") the repo to your computer.

We will go over this process (or "workflow") in class.

The biggest rule is this: do not work in any folders (or make changes to any
folders) in the class repository. Copy files into your working folder. That way
the instructors won't erase or overwrite any of your work!

#### What am I viewing here?

You are viewing the README.md file in the current directory. It is written in
[Markdown] [1] -- a plain text formatting syntax which emphasizes readability.
It is recommended that you always have a README.md in the root directory of
your GitHub project. For viewing and editing Markdown files on your
computer, try [MacDown] [2].
